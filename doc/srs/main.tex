\section{overview}
When playing in a band, you need to agree on a song structure (chords, breaks, bars, lyrics, ...). There are a lot of way to do that, you can have
partitions, use some free or commercial software ( lilypond, guitarpro, musescore, ... ). Each one has its pros and cons.

What we want here is to generate pdf files, that can be printed or viewed on a phone or tablet, and used during music practice, to communicate
between member of the bands. We want a synthetic view, where everything stands in one page (not the lyrics or the details)

	\label{fig:sample_image}  % Label for referencing the image
