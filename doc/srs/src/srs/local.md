# <a id="local"/> local mode

in local mode, you have access to a machine where you cloned the repo that has the songs, and you also
cloned the repo that has the code of the tool. (currently they are in the same repo)

it requires that you have some computer science knowledge, as you will have to install a few things,
edit the data files and run the tool

look at [installation](/ssdd/setup.md#setup) procedure for configuring the machine.
