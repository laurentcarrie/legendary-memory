\couplet{couplet 1}{ \lolocomment{ 8 mesures } \\
I was so high, I did not recognize \\
The fire burning in her eyes \\
The chaos that controlled my mind \\
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane \\
Never to return again but always in my heart, oh
}

\refrain{refrain 1}{ \lolocomment{ 2 lignes } \\
This love has taken its toll on me \\
She said goodbye too many times before \\
And her heart is breakin' in front of me \\
And I have no choice \\
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Whoa \\
Whoa \\

\couplet{couplet 2}{\\
I tried my best to feed her appetite \\
Keep her coming every night \\
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh \\
Kept playing love like it was just a game \\
Pretending to feel the same \\
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh \\
}

This love has taken its toll on me \\

\pont{pont }{\\
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings \\
And make sure everything's all right (it's all right, it's all right) \\
My pressure on your hips, I'm sinking my fingertips \\
Every inch of you \\
Because I know that's what you want me to do
