Can't stop, addicted to the shindig \\
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big \\
Choose not a life of imitation \\
Distant cousin to the reservation \\

Defunkt the pistol that you pay for \\
This punk, the feeling that you stay for \\
In time, I want to be your best friend \\
East Side love is living on the West End \\

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to \\
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do \\
Go write your message on the pavement \\
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant \\
\\
White heat is screaming in the jungle \\
Complete the motion if you stumble \\
Go ask the dust for any answers \\
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers}

The world I love, the tears I drop \\
To be part of the wave, can't stop \\
Ever wonder if it's all for you? \\

The world I love, the trains I hop \\
To be part of the wave, can't stop \\
Come and tell me when it's time to}

\couplet{refrain}{\\
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone \\
So smart, she's leading me to ozone \\
Music the great communicator \\
Use two sticks to make it in the nature \\
\\
I'll get you into penetration \\
The gender of a generation \\
The birth of every other nation \\
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation \\
\\
This chapter's going to be a close one \\
Smoke rings, I know you're going to blow one \\
All on a spaceship, persevering \\
Use my hands for everything but steering \\
\\
Can't stop the spirits when they need you \\
Mop tops are \footnote{Note} happy when they feed you \\
J. Butterfly is in the treetop \\
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop \\}

Come and tell me when it's time to}

\pont{pont}{\\
Wait a minute, I'm passing out, win or lose \\
Just like you \\
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew \\
How about you? \\
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new \\
Just like you \\
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew \\
Right on cue}

Kick-start the golden generator \\
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her \\
Can't stop the gods from engineering \\
Feel no need for any interfering \\

Your image in the dictionary \\
This life is more than ordinary \\
Can I get two, maybe even three of these? \\
Come from space to teach you of the Pleiades \\

Can't stop the spirits when they need you \\
This life is more than just a read-through
