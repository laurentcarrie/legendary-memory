		Childhood living  / Is easy to do \\
		The things you wanted / I bought them for you \\
		Graceless lady / You know who I am \\
		You know I can't let you / Slide through my hands \\
		Wild horses / Couldn't drag me away \\
		Wild, wild horses  / Couldn't drag me away \\

		I watched you suffer / A dull aching pain\\
		Now you've decided / To show me the same\\
		No sweeping exit / Or offstage lines\\
		Could make me feel bitter / Or treat you unkind \\
		Wild horses / Couldn't drag me away \\
		Wild, wild horses / Couldn't drag me away\\

		I know I've dreamed you / A sin and a lie \\
		I have my freedom / But I don't have much time \\
		Faith has been broken / Tears must be cried \\
		Let's do some living / After we die \\
		Wild horses / Couldn't drag me away \\
		Wild, wild horses  / We'll ride them some day \\
		Wild horses / Couldn't drag me away \\
		Wild, wild horses  / We'll ride them some day \\
