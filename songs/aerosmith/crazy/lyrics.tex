Come here, baby \\
You know you drive me up the wall \\
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull \\
Seems like we're making up more than we're making love \\
And it always seems you got something on your mind other than me \\
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways \\
You hear me?

That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave \\
