Take me on a trip, I'd like to go someday \\
Take me to New York, I'd love to see L.A. \\
I really want to come kick it with you \\
You'll be my American boy

He said "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet you" \\
I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type \\
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking \\
Don't like his baggy jeans \\
But I'mma like what's underneath them \\
\\
And no I ain't been to M.I.A \\
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's heart awaits \\
First let's see the west end, I'll show you to my brethren \\
I'm liking this American boy, American boy \\

Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway \\
Let's go shopping, baby, then we'll go to a caf√© \\
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood \\
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good \\
Dress in all your fancy clothes \\
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes \\
Walking that walk, talk that slick talk \\
I'm liking this American boy, American boy

Would you be my love, my love? (Would you be mine?) \\
Would you be my love, my love? (Would you be mine?) \\
Could you be my love, my love? \\
Ooh, would you be my American boy? American boy \\
