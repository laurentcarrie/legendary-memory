\\
Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway \\
Let's go shopping, baby, then we'll go to a caf√© \\
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood \\
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good \\
Dress in all your fancy clothes \\
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes \\
Walking that walk, talk that slick talk \\
I'm liking this American boy, American boy
\\
