\\
I was told I'd feel nothing the first time \\
You were slow to heal \\
But this could be the night \\
If there is a light you can't always see \\
And there is a world we can't always be \\
If there is a dark within and without \\
And there is a light, don't let it go out \\
And this is a song, a song for someone \\

This is a song, this is a song for someone \\
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah \\
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah \\
And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary \\
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be \\
If there is a light you can't always see \\
And there is a world we can't always be \\
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth \\
And there is a light, don't let it go out \\
 \\
