Oh-yeah \\
Oh-yeah \\
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend \\
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send \\
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper then they seem \\
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed \\
So let me be and I'll set you free \\
(Oh-yeah) \\
I am in misery \\
There ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh-yeah \\
Why won't you answer me? \\
The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah \\
Girl, you really got me bad \\
You really got me bad \\
Now I'm gonna get you back \\
I'm gonna get you back \\
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine \\
The way it feels to be completely intertwined \\
Not that I didn't care, It's that I didn't know \\
It's not what I didn't feel, It's what I didn't show \\
So let me be and I'll set you free \\
I am in misery \\
There ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh-yeah \\
Why won't you answer me? \\
The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah \\
Girl, you really got me bad \\
You really got me bad \\
Now I'm gonna get you back \\
Now I'm gonna get you back, yeah \\
You say your faith is shaken and you may be mistaken \\
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun \\
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you \\
And I'm getting near, I don't care where I have to run \\
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah \\
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah \\
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah \\
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah \\
I am in misery \\
There ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh-yeah \\
Why won't you answer me? \\
The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah \\
Girl, you really got me bad \\
You really got me bad \\
Now I'm gonna get you back \\
Now I'm gonna get you back, come on \\
Girl, you really got me bad \\
You really got me bad \\
Now I'm gonna get you back \\
I'm gonna get you back \\
Girl, you really got me bad \\
You really got me bad \\
Now I'm gonna get you back \\
I'm gonna get you back \\
Girl, you really got me bad \\
You really got me bad \\
Now I'm gonna get you back \\
I'm gonna get you back \\
