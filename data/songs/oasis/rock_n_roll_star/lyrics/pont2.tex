\\
I live my life for the stars that shine \\
People say it's just a waste of time \\
When they said I should feed my head \\
Well, that to me was just a day in bed \\
I'll take my car and drive real far \\
You're not concerned about the way we are \\
In my mind my dreams are real \\
Now you're concerned about the way I feel \\
