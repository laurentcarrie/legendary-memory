			Defunkt the pistol that you pay for \\
			This punk, the feeling that you stay for \\
			In time, I want to be your best friend \\
			East Side love is living on the West End \\

\\
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to \\
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do \\
Go write your message on the pavement \\
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant \\
\\
Kick-start the golden generator \\
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her \\
Can't stop the gods from engineering \\
Feel no need for any interfering \\
\\
Your image in the dictionary \\
This life is more than ordinary \\
Can I get two, maybe even three of these? \\
Come from space to teach you of the Pleiades \\
