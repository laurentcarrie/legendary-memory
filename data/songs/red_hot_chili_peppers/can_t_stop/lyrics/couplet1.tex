\\
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig \\
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big \\
Choose not a life of imitation \\
Distant cousin to the reservation \\
\\
\begin{footnotesize}
	{\color{gray}\sout{
			Defunkt the pistol that you pay for \\
			This punk, the feeling that you stay for \\
			In time, I want to be your best friend \\
			East Side love is living on the West End \\

\\
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to \\
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do \\
Go write your message on the pavement \\
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant \\
\\
White heat is screaming in the jungle \\
Complete the motion if you stumble \\
Go ask the dust for any answers \\
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
