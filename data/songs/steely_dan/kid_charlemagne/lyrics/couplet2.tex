On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene \\
But yours was kitchen-clean \\
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home \\
Every A-Frame had your number on the wall \\
You must have had it all \\
You'd go to L.A. on a dare and you'd go it alone \\
Could you see the day? \\
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away? \\
Get along, get along, Kid Charlemagne \\
Get along, Kid Charlemagne \\
Now your patrons have all left you in the red \\
Your low-rent friends are dead \\
This life can be very strange \\
All those Day-Glo freaks who used to paint the face \\
They've joined the human race \\
Some things will never change \\
You are obsolete \\
Look at all the white men on the street \\
Get along, get along, Kid Charlemagne \\
Get along, Kid Charlemagne \\
Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail \\
Those test tubes and the scale \\
Just get it all out of here \\
Is there gas in the car? \\
Yes, there's gas in the car \\
I think the people down the hall know who you are \\
'Cause the man is wise \\
You are still an outlaw in their eyes \\
Get along (get along), get along, Kid Charlemagne (get along) \\
Get along, Kid Charlemagne \\
